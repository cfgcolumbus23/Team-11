- What will the data from the assessment look like? Which are the buckets/categories of assessment results? Ask for examples
    - Answer:
    - using ohio standard for early learning
        - they measure 4 big domains
            1. physical mobility - testing if they can stand/walk
            2. social, emotional - testing wellness/awareness
            3. math literacy - identify numbers, counting
            4. reading literacy - letter identification, letter sounds, reading names
            - They use brigance assessment - brief assesment 0-5 ages (different assessments per age)
                - put into platform to analyze
                - based on the results of the assessment kids
            - also add multiple different views
            - parents can see the progress of their kids (what if they could report important milestones?)
            - people providing external resources can mark attendance
            - consolidate interventions
- Solution:
    - Student takes assessment
    - Assessment is put into our app
    - Our app generates a report based on student's needs (based on the 4 categories tested)
    - Our app generates referrals or recommendations on where the student can go to improve the different categories
    - The student goes to get support from the support group
    - The support group checks into the app periodically to update studentâ€™s progress
    - Repeat cycle until age of 5 or until they enter KG
    
Preliminary database model idea:

- We are building for one region
- Multiple centers which have
- Assessments
- Students (has assessments, comments, data)
- Teachers (has their class)
- Parents / Guardians
- Intervention Specialists (has tier 2 and tier 3 students)
